# trilogy-programmer
A programmer to change a Crumar Trilogy into a programmable synth/strings/organ

Initially the project is to design a replacement programming section for the aged Crumar Trilogy synth/strings/organ. It will allow all the settings of the trilogy where possible to be stored in 32 locations thus expanding the limited programming of the trilogy.

This application should lend itself to adding a programmer to any analogue synth with CV control for parameters, even a modular.

It will be scalable with 16 way mux/demux 4017 boards from 16 to 64 inputs and outputs

Completed to a point where all the synth functions of the Trilogy can be stored in memory, not enough MUX/DEMUX channels left to complete the strings and organ sections.

Still to do.

Add volume control of the synth, strings & organ to the programmer
Add the VCF pedal switch into the programmer (I've never used the pedal so I dont know why)
