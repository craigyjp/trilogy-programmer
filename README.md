# trilogy-programmer
creating a programmer to change a Crumar Trilogy into a programmable synth/strings/organ

Initially the project is to design a replacement programming section for the aged Crumar Trilogy synth/strings/organ. It will allow all the settings of the trilogy where possible to be stored in 64 locations thus expanding the limited programming of the trilogy.

This application should lend itself to adding a programmer to any analogue synth with CV control for parameters, even a modular.

It will be scalable with 16 way mux/demux 4017 boards from 16 to 64 inputs and outputs
